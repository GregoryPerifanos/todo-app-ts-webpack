# Todo App – Frontend Mentor Challenge (TypeScript + Webpack + Babel)

This is my solution to the [Todo App challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW), but built with **TypeScript, Webpack, and Babel**.

The project is a fully responsive, theme-switching Todo list that saves todos in localStorage.  
It uses Webpack to bundle everything, Babel for compatibility, and TypeScript for type safety.

---

## Built With

- HTML5 + CSS3 (Flexbox)
- TypeScript
- Webpack 5
- Babel (preset-env + preset-typescript)
- LocalStorage for saving todos
- Frontend Mentor design assets

---

## How To Run It Locally

1. Clone this repo
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Start the dev server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
Webpack will automatically open your browser and serve the app locally.

 ## What I Learned Doing This
- Setting up Webpack with TypeScript and Babel from scratch

- Using Webpack asset modules for images and CSS

- Structuring clean, type-safe JavaScript with TypeScript

- Managing UI state (filters, theme toggle) using vanilla JS + TypeScript

- Using localStorage for persistence

## Notes

* No frameworks used—pure HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Webpack, Babel.

* Uses HtmlWebpackPlugin to auto-inject bundled JS.

* Light and dark mode toggle included.
